*The cropping and warping error detection tool*

What is CWDET?
-----------------
*Help! I have a million images and I'm sure there are some documents with unwanted warping and cropping errors on scans, but which are they?*

Checking to identify warping and cropping errors on scan manually is a very time-consuming and error-prone process. You need a tool to help you: CWDET.

CWDET is an open source tool which:

* provides decision-making support for warping and cropping error on scans detection in or across digital collections
* identifies warping and cropping errors even independent from file format, scan quality, sizes, direction, shape, colour and illumination 
* applies state-of-the art image processing  
* is useful in assembling collections from multiple sources, and identifying corrupted files

What Can CWDET Do For Me?
----------------------------
CWDET brings the following benefits:

* Automated quality assurance
* Reduced manual effort and error
* Saved time
* Lower costs, e.g. storage, effort
* Open source, standalone tool. Also as Taverna component for easy invocation
* Invariant to format, rotation, scale, translation, illumination, resolution, cropping, warping and distortions
* May be applied to wide range of image collections, not just print images

Examples
--------

There are numerous situations in which you may need to identify images with warping and cropping errors in collections, for example:

* to ensure that a page or book has no corrupted pages
* to ensure that text obstructed by the warping or cropping error is lost
