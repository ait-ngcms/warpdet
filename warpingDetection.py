##          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
##          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
##          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
##          as modifying the License.
##
##      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
##      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
##      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
##      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
##      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
##      the conditions stated in this License.
##
##   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
##      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
##      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
##      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
##      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify

##
##   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

##      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
##      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

##   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
##      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
##      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
##      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
##      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
##      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
##      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
##      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
##      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
##
##   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
##      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
##      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
##      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
##      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
##      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
##      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
##      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
##      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
##      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
##      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
##
##   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
##      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
##      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
##      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
##      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
##      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
##      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
##      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
##      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
##      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# Name:        warpingDetection.py
# Purpose:     This file supports analysis of digital collection (e.g. JPG files)
#              for warping and cropping problems during the automated scan process.
#              In order to detect warping or cropping problems we involve six use cases:
#                 1. Text is shifted to the one side of the image and other border
#                    is much wider than first rand.
#                 2. There is no gap between text and image border - text is cut
#                    by the rand.
#                 3. Image comprises part of the text from previous page.
#                 4. Text page is rotated.
#                 5. Text page is warped optically.
#                 6. Text page is warped physically.

'''
Image profile based image cropping detection in digital book collection for quality assurance.

USAGE
  warpingDetection.py [--randdistance=3] [--randrelation=5] [ <source dir> ]

randdistance: defines which part of the image width on X axis should be analyzed for rand calculation
(e.g. 3 means 1/3 part)
randrelation: defines which relation between left and right rand is acceptible to regard image as OK
(e.g. 5 means one rand could be 5 times bigger than other)
